# solid-pods-management

This is an implementation of a SOLID POD management system. This implementation is in continious progress.
This application is being developed to try to improve the user experience so it is easier and clearier for a user to interact with its POD (Personal Online Data Stores).The application is being developed in collaboration with the WESO research group and empathy.co, a company from northern Spain, established in Gij√≥n, but with international transcendence.

The main objectives of this application are the following:

Improve user experience for the moment, interacting with a POD is complex and difficult if you're not used to the computer science world. We're trying to make it easier to the users to manage the data they want to store in their POD, because the first step to gain users, is making their life easier.Improve security and privacy.
